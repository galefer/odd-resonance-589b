      <h2>Selecting Your Origin</h2>
      <p>Deciding where your character originates can be a daunting task, especially when the entire cosmology is relevant in Outworld.</p>
      <p>For that reason, the standard — and only <em>legal</em> — origin is <strong>Toril</strong>.</p>

      <h3>What is Toril?</h3>
      <p>Toril is the main planet within Realmspace, the crystal sphere that houses the Forgotten Realms. Known for its rich magic, diverse cultures, and countless adventures, Toril includes continents like Faerûn, Kara-Tur, and Zakhara, each with its own unique history and significance.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Faerûn:</strong> The most famous continent, home to iconic cities such as Waterdeep, Baldur’s Gate, and Neverwinter.</li>
        <li><strong>Kara-Tur:</strong> An eastern continent with vast empires, mystical landscapes, and martial traditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Zakhara:</strong> Known as the Land of Fate — a southern realm of deserts, faith, and elemental magic.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="info-box warning">
        <strong>Requests:</strong> Other canonical origins may be considered.<br>
        If you wish to create a character originating outside of Toril, please liaise with staff directly to discuss and obtain approval.<br>

    <section class="info-section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p>Answers to the most common questions surrounding the Dead World and the scope of the Outworld Archive.</p>

      <div class="faq">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Q: What is the Greater Cosmology of D&D?</h3>
          <p>The Greater Cosmology refers to the full scope of the Dungeons & Dragons multiverse — every plane, world, and sourcebook across editions. Outworld draws inspiration and material from this entire breadth of lore.</p>
          <p>This means the world you’re entering may reflect echoes of any D&D setting, entity, or planar concept, from the Astral Sea to the Far Realm, from forgotten gods to obscure magical laws. If it exists in D&D, it can find its way into Outworld.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Q: What is the Dead World, and what do I know about it?</h3>
          <p>Outworld takes place on the Dead World — a realm of ruin, rot, and forgotten echoes. You have no prior knowledge of the Dead World. To scholars and travelers of the multiverse, it is an anomaly: no charts, no legends. It is as if the world was wiped from memory, or deliberately hidden.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Q: How did I arrive on the Dead World?</h3>
          <p>Arrival is always accidental. Choose any method that fits D&D canon and your character's background. Here are five common examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Spelljammer Crash:</strong> A vessel lost in Wildspace or the Astral Sea crashed unexpectedly onto the Dead World.</li>
            <li><strong>Planar Gate Mishap:</strong> A malfunctioning Gate, Teleport, or Plane Shift spell left you stranded in the wrong realm.</li>
            <li><strong>Artifact Backlash:</strong> Contact with a mysterious or cursed artifact hurled you into this unknown world.</li>
            <li><strong>Divine or Cosmic Exile:</strong> A failed resurrection, punishment by a god, or divine anomaly cast you here.</li>
            <li><strong>Shadowfell / Feywild Convergence:</strong> A planar overlap drew you across the veil, and you never made it back.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Q: I was powerful in my old world. Do I keep that power here?</h3>
          <p>No. Regardless of what you were before — archmage, chosen of a god, or warlord of a thousand realms — you arrive here as you are now: stripped down, hollowed out, and holding onto little more than memory.</p>
          <p>Everyone starts at level 1. The Dead World doesn’t care who you were. Whatever power you once had was drained, severed, or left behind. All that matters here is what you become.</p>
